   - VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit) monitoring
   - Fan control and air management

3. **Water Management**
   - Drip system control
   - Water flow monitoring
   - Irrigation scheduling

4. **Automation**
   - Scene management
   - Auto mode operation
   - Manual control modes

##### Technical Architecture
- **Communication**: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) + WiFi/Internet
- **Cloud Platform**: Firebase (Project: `mars-pro-930a4`)
- **Security**: Heavy code obfuscation, likely encrypted strings
- **Platform**: Flutter with native Android components

##### Security Analysis
- **High obfuscation level**: All class names and methods obfuscated
- **String encryption**: Likely present based on obfuscation patterns
- **Native code**: BLE communication likely in native libraries
- **Anti-debugging**: Possible anti-debugging measures

### üöß Current Challenges

#### Static Analysis Limitations
1. **Code Obfuscation**: All meaningful identifiers are obfuscated
2. **Native Libraries**: BLE communication likely in native code
3. **String Encryption**: Important strings may be encrypted
4. **Limited Visibility**: Cannot determine exact BLE protocol from static analysis

#### Dynamic Analysis Requirements
1. **Rooted Android Device**: Required for Frida server
2. **Physical MarsPro Device**: Needed for protocol discovery
3. **Network Monitoring**: Required for API endpoint discovery
4. **Real-time Analysis**: Need to capture live communication

### üìã Next Steps

#### Phase 2: Dynamic Analysis (Pending)
1. **Setup Requirements**
   - Obtain rooted Android device
   - Install Frida server
   - Set up network monitoring tools
   - Obtain MarsPro device for testing

2. **Protocol Discovery**
   - Hook BLE operations with Frida
   - Monitor network traffic
   - Document service UUIDs and characteristics
   - Reverse engineer command protocols

3. **Data Collection**
   - Capture BLE communication patterns
   - Document API endpoints
   - Understand authentication flow
   - Map device control commands

#### Phase 3: Implementation (Future)
1. **BLE Communication Library**
   - Implement MarsPro BLE client
   - Support device discovery and connection
   - Handle command sending and data reading
   - Implement error handling

2. **Home Assistant Integration**
   - Create custom component
   - Implement device entities (sensors, switches, etc.)
   - Add configuration flow
   - Support multiple devices

3. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test with real MarsPro devices
   - Validate all features work correctly
   - Performance testing
   - Error handling validation
