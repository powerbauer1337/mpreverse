## Code Analysis

### Obfuscation Level
- **High obfuscation**: All class names and methods are obfuscated with single-letter package names
- **String encryption**: Likely present based on obfuscation patterns
- **Native code**: Possible native libraries for BLE communication

### Flutter Structure
The app is built with Flutter and includes:
- Custom assets for UI elements (confirmed from AssetManifest.json)
- Multiple language support (config splits for different languages)
- Responsive design elements
- Platform-specific integrations

### Bundle Structure
The app uses Android App Bundle (XAPK) format with:
- Base APK: `com.marspro.meizhi.apk`
- Language splits: ar, it, my, vi, ko, fr, zh, hi, in, tr, ru, en, ja, de, th, es, pt
- Architecture split: arm64_v8a
- Density split: xxhdpi

## Security Analysis

### Code Protection
- Heavy obfuscation makes static analysis challenging
- Likely uses code obfuscation tools (ProGuard/R8)
- Native code components for sensitive operations

### Network Security
- Uses HTTPS for cloud communication
- Firebase security rules likely in place
- BLE communication may be encrypted

## Reverse Engineering Challenges

### Static Analysis Limitations
1. **Obfuscated Code**: All meaningful identifiers are obfuscated with single-letter names
2. **Native Libraries**: BLE communication likely in native code
3. **String Encryption**: Important strings may be encrypted
4. **Anti-Debugging**: Possible anti-debugging measures

### Dynamic Analysis Opportunities
1. **Frida Hooks**: Can intercept BLE communication
2. **Network Monitoring**: Can capture API calls
3. **Runtime Analysis**: Can observe actual behavior

## Home Assistant Integration Strategy
