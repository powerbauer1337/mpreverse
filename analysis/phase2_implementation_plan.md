## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Heavy Obfuscation**
   - **Risk**: Code too obfuscated to analyze
   - **Mitigation**: Focus on dynamic analysis, use Frida hooks

2. **Native Code**
   - **Risk**: BLE communication in native libraries
   - **Mitigation**: Use Frida to hook native functions

3. **Encryption**
   - **Risk**: Communication encrypted
   - **Mitigation**: Analyze at application level, document encryption

### Hardware Risks
1. **Device Availability**
   - **Risk**: No physical MarsPro device
   - **Mitigation**: Use emulator or borrow device

2. **Root Access**
   - **Risk**: Cannot root Android device
