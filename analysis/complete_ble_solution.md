## üéØ **Recommended Approach**

### **Phase 1: Immediate Results (nRF Connect)**
**Start with this immediately** - it will give you working results in 15 minutes:

1. **Install nRF Connect** on your Android phone
2. **Configure MarsPro GATT Server**:
   - Service UUID: `0000ffe0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
   - Command: `0000ffe1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` (Write)
   - Data: `0000ffe2-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` (Read, Notify)
   - Status: `0000ffe4-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` (Read, Notify)
3. **Start advertising** as "MarsPro Controller"
4. **Test with MarsPro app**

### **Phase 2: Full Development (WSL2)**
**Set up in parallel** for complete development capabilities:

1. **Get administrator access** to your computer
2. **Follow WSL2 setup guide** in `scripts/wsl2_setup_guide.md`
3. **Run the setup script** to create full emulator
4. **Develop complete protocol implementation**

### **Phase 3: Protocol Discovery**
**Use both approaches** to discover the complete protocol:

1. **Use nRF Connect** to observe real app behavior
2. **Use WSL2 emulator** to test responses
3. **Document all patterns** discovered
4. **Implement in Home Assistant integration**

## üìã **Action Plan**

### **Immediate Actions (Next 30 minutes)**
1. **Install nRF Connect** on Android phone
2. **Set up MarsPro GATT server** following the guide
3. **Test with MarsPro app**
4. **Document initial protocol patterns**

### **Short-term Actions (Next 2 hours)**
1. **Get administrator access** to computer
2. **Set up WSL2** following the guide
3. **Run BLE emulator setup script**
4. **Test full emulator functionality**

### **Medium-term Actions (Next 1-2 days)**
1. **Complete protocol discovery** using both tools
2. **Implement all MarsPro commands** in WSL2 emulator
3. **Test Home Assistant integration** with emulator
4. **Document complete protocol specification**

## üîß **Troubleshooting**

### **nRF Connect Issues**
- **App won't connect**: Check UUIDs match exactly
- **No advertising**: Ensure advertising is enabled
- **Permission errors**: Grant location permissions

### **WSL2 Issues**
- **Administrator required**: Run PowerShell as Administrator
- **Virtualization disabled**: Enable in BIOS (Intel VT-x or AMD-V)
- **Bluetooth not working**: Check Windows Bluetooth settings

### **Windows BLE Issues**
- **No Bluetooth adapter**: Use nRF Connect on Android instead
- **Scanner fails**: Ensure Bluetooth is enabled in Windows
- **Permission errors**: Run as administrator if needed
