- When writing integration tests, make sure to set up the program, call the tool and then validate the output. If the tool modifies the program, validate the modification.
- Don't write useless tests, make sure they have a purpose.
- **CRITICAL**: Integration tests should validate actual Ghidra program state changes, not just MCP tool responses
