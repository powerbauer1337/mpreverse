# ReVa - Reverse Engineering Assistant

> Rewritten from scratch as a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/faqs) server!

The reverse engineering assistant (ReVa) is a project to build a model agnostic AI assistant for
reverse engineering tasks. This includes both _offline_ and online inference and a simple architecture.

ReVa is different from other efforts at building AI assistants for RE tasks because it uses a _tool driven approach_.
ReVa aims to provide a variety of small tools to the LLM, just as your RE environment provides a set of small tools
to you. ReVa combines this approach with chain-of-reasoning techniques to empower the LLM to complete complex tasks.

Each of the tools given to the LLM are constructed to be easy for the LLM to use and to tolerate a variety of inputs
and to reduce hallucination by the LLM. We do this by providing the LLM with a schema but tolerating other input,
including descriptions that guide the LLM,and redirecting correctable mistakes back to the LLM, and including extra
output to guide the next decision by the LLM.

To encourage exploration as a human would, we report additional context like the namespace and cross references along with the decompilation, this
is a small nudge to make the LLM explore the binary in the same way a human would.

Using this technique you can ask general questions and get relevant answers. The model prioritises
information from the tools, but when there is no information it can still respond to generic
questions from its training.

As an MCP server, ReVa can be used alongside other MCP servers to enrich its analysis.
For example you can use the [GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server)
to allow ReVa access to source code on GitHub, or the
[Kagi MCP Server](https://github.com/kagisearch/kagimcp) to allow ReVa to search the web.

You can ask questions like:
- Examine the programs in this project and explain the relationship between the main binary and the shared libraries.
- What are the interesting strings in this program?
- Does this program use encryption? Write a markdown report on the encryption and where it is used.
- Draw a class diagram using plantuml syntax.
- Start from main, examine the program in detail. Rename variables as you go and provide a summary of the program.
- Explain the purpose of the `__mod_init` segment.
- What does `mmap` return?
- What does the function at address 0x80000 do?
- This is a CTF problem. Write a pwntools script to get the flag.

# Installation

> NOTE: ReVa only supports Ghidra 11.3 and above!

ReVa is a Ghidra extension. To install it, you can download the release for your
version of Ghidra from the releases page and install it using the Ghidra extension manager.

Alternatively, you can build it from source. To do this, clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
export GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/ghidra
gradle
```

Then install the extension (in `dist/`) using the Ghidra extension manager.

## MCP configuration
ReVa uses the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/faqs) to communicate with the LLM.

ReVa uses the [SSE MCP transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#server-sent-events-sse)
and will listen on port `8080` by default, you can change this in the Ghidra settings from the project view.

You will need to configure your MCP client to connect to ReVa, this depends on the client you are using.

### Claude

With Claude you can open your MCP configuration file by opening the Claude
app, opening the settings and then the Developer tab. You can click `Edit Config` to
locate the configuration file.

Add a block to the `mcpServers` section of the configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ReVa": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://localhost:8080/mcp/sse"
      ]
    }
  }
}

```

### VSCode

> If you use Claude Desktop, there is an [automatic discovery feature in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_automatic-discovery-of-mcp-servers)
> that will automatically configure the MCP server for you.

VSCode has a built in MCP client, instructions to configure it can be found
in the [GitHub Copilot documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers#_add-an-mcp-server-to-your-user-settings).

Note that VSCode supports `sse` natively, so you do not need to use `mcp-remote`.
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "ReVa": {
        "type": "sse",
        "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp/sse"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### oterm - Ollama

[oterm](https://ggozad.github.io/oterm/) is a TUI interface for [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and works well locally with ReVa.

For best results, use a reasoning model like `Qwen3`.

See the [oterm documentation](https://ggozad.github.io/oterm/mcp/#sse-transport) for instructions on how to configure
oterm to use ReVa.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ReVa": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp/sse"
    }
  }
}
```
