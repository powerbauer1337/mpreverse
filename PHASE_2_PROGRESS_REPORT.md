## Technical Implementation Details

### BLE Client Architecture

```python
class MarsProBLEClient:
    # Service UUIDs (placeholder - to be discovered)
    SERVICE_UUID = "0000ffe0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb"
    COMMAND_CHAR_UUID = "0000ffe1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb"
    DATA_CHAR_UUID = "0000ffe2-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb"
    
    # Command codes for all device features
    CMD_SET_LIGHT = 0x10
    CMD_SET_TEMPERATURE = 0x20
    CMD_SET_HUMIDITY = 0x21
    CMD_SET_FAN = 0x30
    CMD_SET_DRIP = 0x40
    # ... and more
```

### Device Features Supported

- **Lighting**: Main light, UV light, vegetative light, PPFD control
- **Climate**: Temperature, humidity, CO2, VPD control
- **Air**: Fan speed, wind control, air volume
- **Water**: Drip system, flow rate control
- **Heating**: Heating pad control
- **Power**: Socket/outlet control
- **Automation**: Timer, scene management, auto mode

### Data Structures

```python
@dataclass
class MarsProSensorData:
    temperature: Optional[float] = None
    humidity: Optional[float] = None
    co2: Optional[float] = None
    vpd: Optional[float] = None
    ppfd: Optional[float] = None
    wind_speed: Optional[float] = None
    wind_pressure: Optional[float] = None
    air_volume: Optional[float] = None
    timestamp: Optional[float] = None
```

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- **Static Analysis**: Complete and successful
- **BLE Client Implementation**: Comprehensive and tested
- **Project Structure**: Well-organized and documented

### Medium Risk
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Requires physical device and setup
- **Protocol Discovery**: May be complex due to obfuscation
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Depends on protocol discovery

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Device Access**: Source test device or use emulator
2. **Protocol Complexity**: Use Frida for runtime analysis
3. **Integration**: Incremental development with testing

## Success Metrics
